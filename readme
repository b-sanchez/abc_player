This program uses abc files, a type of music file which is formatted a certain way.  The program parses these files
and then uses abstract data types and Java MIDI to play the music.

Run Main and type the file name into the console to play the abc file associated with it.
e.g: sample_abc/fur_elise.abc
Restart the Main method before you play the next piece.
